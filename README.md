**DESCRIPTION**

### What Is API Integration?

API integration lets different apps talk to each other by sharing information back and forth. In a full-stack web dev project, it helps pull, work with, and show data live in your app.

For instance, in your Weather App, you use the OpenWeatherMap API to get real-time weather info based on the city the user types in.

#### Tools You Can Use for API Integration

**Frontend (Client Side)**  

- **HTML**: Builds the structure of the page.  
- **CSS**: Makes it look good and works on different screens.  
- **JavaScript (JS)**: Gets the API data and updates what users see without reloading the page.  

**Backend (If Needed)**  

- **Node.js**: Manages tasks on the server side if you need one.  
- **Express.js**: A simple tool for handling API requests on the backend.  

**API Tools**  

- **Fetch API**: Helps JS reach out to external APIs.  
- **Postman**: Tests API endpoints before putting them into your app.  
- **CORS**: Lets websites share resources across different domains.
- **OPENWEATHER API**:Helps to provide the weather data.
